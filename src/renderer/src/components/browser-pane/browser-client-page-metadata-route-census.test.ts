/**
 * Page metadata has exactly one way out of this renderer: main, which owns the browser-host lease.
 *
 * Why a census and not a behavioural test: the failure this guards is silent. The runtime accepts
 * page traffic only on the connection its lease attached on, so a publish sent as an ordinary
 * runtime call is refused as a stale lease and simply never lands — the pane keeps working, the
 * guest keeps navigating, and only the runtime's copy of the URL stays frozen at the create URL.
 * Nothing in the rendered result changes, so only the route itself can be asserted.
